# Sticky Notes App

A simple web application to manage sticky notes, allowing users to add, update, delete, reverse, and clear all notes. The app uses **IndexedDB** for storing notes persistently and provides a clean, user-friendly interface.

## Features

- **Add a note**: Users can write and save notes using the provided text area.
- **Update a note**: Edit existing notes directly.
- **Delete a note**: Remove individual notes.
- **Reverse note order**: Change the display order of the notes.
- **Clear all notes**: Remove all saved notes.
- **Persistent storage**: Notes are stored using IndexedDB, so they persist even after the page is refreshed.
